# Tic Tac Toe

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
You will need to have Node (6), Redis, Gulp, Webpack and installed on your system globally.  After installing Node, run the following commands.  Mac users should use Brew, and Linux users should use apt-get.

```
npm install -g gulp webpack
```

<h3>Compiling</h3>

Simply run `npm install` and `gulp build` from the root of the project.  This will compile client files into `/app/`.

<h3>Start the app (redis-server must be installed globally as this will run redis-server)</h3>

npm run start
```
